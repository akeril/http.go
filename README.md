This is my solution for the ["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) by [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server that is capable of serving multiple clients.

Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers, [HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html), and more.
